      "textContent": "California just enacted a new law further expanding protections for freelance workers. Beginning in 2025, private employers who hire certain independent contractors will be required to provide a written agreement specifying certain terms and to pay their compensation by certain deadlines. The new law aims to give freelancers “basic worker protections” and the right to be paid on time. We’ll explain everything you need to know and give you five steps you can take to comply. What Happened? Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 988 into law on September 28, which will take effect on January 1 and impose minimum requirements on contracts between freelance workers and hiring parties. The new state law, known as the “Freelance Worker Protection Act” (FWPA), provides similar protections to freelancers as those provided by the Los Angeles Freelance Worker Protections Ordinance, which took effect last year. Who Must Comply?  The FWPA applies to contracts that are:  between a “hiring party” and “freelance worker;” and entered into or renewed on or after January 1, 2025.  Here are the key terms you should know:  A hiring party means a person or organization in the State of California that retains a freelance worker to provide professional services (other than federal, state, local, or foreign governments or individuals hiring services for the personal benefit of themselves, their family members, or their homestead). A freelance worker means a person that is hired or retained as a bona fide independent contractor by a hiring party to provide professional services in exchange for $250 or more (either from a single contract or when aggregating all contracts between the same hiring party and the independent contractor during the past 120 days). Professional services has the same meaning as that provided under AB 5 (California’s landmark independent contractor law), which includes services such as marketing, human resources, travel agent services, graphic design, grant writing, fine artistry, photography, videography, photo editing, freelance writing, translating, editing, illustrating, and others.  What Does the FWPA Require? Written Contracts The FWPA requires a hiring party to provide a signed copy of a written contract (either physically or electronically) to the freelance worker and keep a copy of the contract for at least four years. The written contract must include, at minimum, the following information:  the name and address of each party; an itemized list of all services that will be provided, including the value of those services and the rate and method of compensation"
